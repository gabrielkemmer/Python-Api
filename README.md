# Product Stock and Customer Information Retrieval Program 

This repository contains a program built with Python, Google Sheet API, Pandas, os, JSON, requests, Excel, 
and scheduler that connects to an API and retrieves information about product stock and customers. The program utilizes 
these technologies to interact with the API, retrieve data in JSON format, process and analyze the data using Pandas, and store 
the results in Excel for further analysis and reporting.

Technologies Used

Python
Python is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It provides extensive 
libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various tasks. In this project, Python serves as the core programming language 
for implementing the logic and interacting with the required APIs and libraries.

Google Sheet API
Google Sheet API enables programmatic access to Google Sheets, providing the ability to read, write, and manipulate spreadsheet data. 
It allows developers to create, update, and retrieve values from Google Sheets. In this project, the Google Sheet API is used to store 
the retrieved data in an Excel file.

Pandas
Pandas is a popular data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides powerful tools for reading, writing, and processing 
data, particularly in tabular form. In this project, Pandas is used to process and analyze the retrieved data from the API in JSON format.

os
The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows accessing file paths, executing system commands, 
and performing various file operations. In this project, the os module is used for file operations, such as managing file paths and 
interacting with the local file system.

JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is widely used for transmitting data between a server 
and a web application. In this project, JSON is utilized as the data format for retrieving information from the API.

requests
The requests library in Python allows sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It simplifies the process of making API calls 
and retrieving data from web services. In this project, requests is used to connect to the API and retrieve the product stock and 
customer information in JSON format.

Excel
Excel is a widely used spreadsheet program that allows users to create and manage data in tabular form. In this project, Excel is 
used to store the retrieved information in a structured manner. The program uses Pandas to process the data and write it to an Excel 
file for further analysis and reporting.

Scheduler
The scheduler module in Python provides a way to schedule the execution of functions at specified intervals. It allows automating 
recurring tasks without manual intervention. In this project, the scheduler is used to schedule the retrieval of product stock and 
customer information from the API at regular intervals.
